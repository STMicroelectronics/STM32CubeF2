@par Example Description 

How to configure the system to measure the current consumption in different 
low-power modes.

The Low-power modes are:
  - Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode without RTC and BKPSRAM
  - STANDBY mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode with RTC and BKPSRAM.
  
To run this example, user has to follow these steps:
 1. Select the Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32f2xx_lp_modes.h file.
    @code
       /*#define SLEEP_MODE*/
       /*#define STOP_MODE*/
       /*#define STANDBY_MODE*/
       #define STANDBY_RTC_MODE
       /*#define STANDBY_RTC_BKPSRAM_MODE*/
    @endcode       

 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the IDD current. 

 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode, this is due to the fact that the 
    Cortex-M3 core is no longer clocked during low power mode so debugging 
    features are disabled

Here below a detailed description of the example code:

 1. After reset, the program waits for Key button connected to the PG.15 to be 
    pressed to enter the selected low power mode.
     - When the RTC is not used in the low power mode configuration, press
       again the Key button or the wake up button to exit the low power mode.
     - When the RTC is used, the wake-up from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after 20s).

 2. Low power modes description:

    - Sleep Mode
    ============  
            - System Running at PLL (120MHz)
            - Flash 5 wait state
            - Instruction and Data caches ON
            - Prefetch OFF       
            - Code running from Internal FLASH
            - All peripherals disabled.
            - Wake-up using EXTI Line (Key Button PG.15)

    - STOP Mode
    ===========
            - RTC Clocked by LSE or LSI
            - Regulator in LP mode
            - HSI, HSE OFF and LSI if not used as RTC Clock source
            - No IWDG
            - FLASH in deep power down mode
            - Automatic Wake-up using RTC clocked by LSE/LSI (after ~20s)

    - STANDBY Mode
    ==============
            - Backup SRAM and RTC OFF
            - IWDG and LSI OFF
            - Wake-up using Wake-up Pin (PA.00)
                        
    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSE/LSI 
    ==========================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSE or LSI
            - IWDG OFF and LSI OFF  if not used as RTC Clock source
            - Backup SRAM OFF
            - Automatic Wake-up using RTC clocked by LSE/LSI (after ~20s)

    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSE/LSI and BKPSRAM
    ======================================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSE or LSI
            - Backup SRAM ON
            - IWDG OFF
            - Automatic Wake-up using RTC clocked by LSE/LSI (after ~20s)
   
STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the example status:
  3. After exit from Low power mode the LED4 is turned ON
  4. The sequence will be repeated from step 1
  - LED3 is ON when there is an error
  

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note  Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select the RTC clock source; in this 
       case the Backup domain will be reset in order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC  
       registers (including the backup registers) and RCC_BDCR register are set to their reset values.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F207xx/217xx device.    
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
   
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PI.09 and PC.07 pins.
    - Use Key Button connected to PG.15 pin.
    - Use Wake up Button connected to PA.00 pin.
    - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is not fitted. 
    - Connect an amperemeter to jumper JP32 to measure the IDD current
