@par Example Description 

How to interrupt continuous ADC regular channel conversion using ADC injected 
channels, and how to get the result of this conversion.

This example describes how to interrupt continuous ADC3 regular channel7 conversion 
using ADC3 injected channel12 and how to get the converted value of this conversion.

The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously regular channel7(for STM322xG-EVAL)
and convert injected channel12 (connected to PC.2) when injected conversion starts
(after one second of the start of regular channel).

Each time a regular channel end of conversion occurs an interrupt is generated 
and the converted data of ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedRegValue 
variable in the ADC conversion complete call back function. After one second of
the start of regular channel8 conversion the injected channel12 conversion starts 
so regular conversion is temporary interrupted until the end of injected conversion, 
when the injected conversion is finished an interrupt is generated and the converted injected 
data of ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedInjValue variable 
in the ADC conversion complete call back function.    

The user can use the debugger's watch to evaluate uhADCxConvertedRegValue and uhADCxConvertedInjValue

In this example, the system clock is 120MHz, APB2 = 60MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
Since ADC3 clock is 30 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/30= 0.5us(2Msps).

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F207xx/217xx device.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to PF.09).
    - Connect PC.2 to a power supply (do not forget to connect the power supply 
      GND to the EVAL board GND)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
