               Encoder interface example description
               
               

  To emulate a quadrature encoder, TIM3 is configured in toggle mode to generate
2 quadrature signals on (PC6 and PC7) at 10KHz. Each 1s, signals change phase
(+90°/-90°) to emulate a Forward/Backward rotation.  

  TIM1 is configured in encoder mode interface, counting on TI1 and TI2.
  The counting direction corresponds to the rotation direction of the connected 
sensor (emulated by TIM3 signals).
Rotation direction can be monitored by putting "uwDirection" variable in the 
Live Watch window.
  When uwDirection = 0, and according to the "Counting direction versus encoder
signals" table, rotation direction is Forward.
  When uwDirection = 1, and according to the "Counting direction versus encoder
signals" table, rotation direction is Backward.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note LED4 is turned ON, because it's sharing the same GPIO pin with the TIM3 channel 2.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F207xx/217xx device.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL  
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PC6(Pin21 in CN3) (TIM3_Channel 1) to PA8(Pin16 in CN3) (TIM1_Channel 1).
    - Connect PC7(Pin20 in CN3) (TIM3_Channel 2) to PE11(Pin26 in CN2) (TIM1_Channel 2).
    - Put uwDirection in the debugger live watch to detect the rotation direction
      change.
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
