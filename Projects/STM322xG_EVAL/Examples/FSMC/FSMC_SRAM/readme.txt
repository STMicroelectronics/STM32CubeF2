@par Example Description 

How to configure the FSMC controller to access the SRAM memory.

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of HAL API
to configure the FMC controller to access the IS61WV102416BLL-10MLI SRAM memory mounted 
on STM322xG-EVAL evaluation board.
 
At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz.
  
The goal of this example is to explain the different steps to configure the FMC 
and make the SRAM device ready for access, without using the MSP layer.          

In this example, the SRAM device is configured and initialized explicitly 
following all initialization sequence steps. After initializing the device, user 
can perform read/write operations on it. A data buffer is written to the SRAM 
memory, then read back and checked to verify its correctness.

The user can chose his own configuration by commenting/uncommenting the defines for  
undesired/desired configurations , for example, to enable Continuous clock feature, 
uncomment the define for the configuration "FMC_CONTINUOUS_CLOCK_SYNC_ASYNC" in "main.h".
  
If the data is read correctly from SRAM, the LED1 is ON, otherwise the LED2 is ON.   
LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F207xx/217xx device.  
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up  
    - Please ensure that the jumper JP10 is not fitted in the position 2-3.
