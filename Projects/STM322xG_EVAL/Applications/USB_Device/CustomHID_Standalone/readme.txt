@par Application Description

Use of the USB device application based on the Custom HID Class.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F2xx USB OTG Device peripheral, where the STM32 MCU is 
enumerated as a HID compliant device using the native PC Host HID driver to which the STM322xG-EVAL
board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL. In the High Speed (HS) mode the
USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

To test the application, user must proceed as follows:
 - Start the "USB HID Demonstrator" PC applet, available for download from www.st.com, 
   and connect STM32 USB to PC
 - The device should be detected and shown in the USB HID target box
 - Press Graphic View button
 - Select "use SET_FEATURE" or "use SET_REPORT" in order to use SET_REPORT request to send HID Report
   for LED control
 - Use the potentiometer of the STM322xG-EVAL board to transfer the result of the converted voltage
  (via the ADC) the to the PC host (these values are sent to the PC using the endpoint1 IN)   
 - Make sure that following report ID are configured: LED1 ID (0x1), LED2 ID(0x2), LED3 ID(0x3),
   LED4 ID(0x4), BUTTON1_ID(0x6) and Potentiometer_ID(0x7).
 - Select LEDs to switch on/off on the STM322xG-EVAL board: a SET_REPORT request will be sent

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

"STM32Cube USB Device library".
      

@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx/STM32F217xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the STM322xG-EVAL board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cable to the connector:
      - CN9: to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN8: to use USB Full Speed (FS)
	- Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted. 
    
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project configuration:
   - STM322xG-EVAL_USBH-HS: to configure the project for STM32F2xx devices using USB OTG HS peripheral
   - STM322xG-EVAL_USBH-FS: to configure the project for STM32F2xx devices using USB OTG FS peripheral
 - Run the application
