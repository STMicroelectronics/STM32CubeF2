@par Application Description 

This application is a part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
USB device application based on the STM32F2xx multi core support feature integrating Mass Storage (MSC) 
and Human Interface (HID) in the same project.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F2xx USB OTG Device peripheral, where STM32 is 
enumerated as a MSC device in the High Speed mode, and also as a HID device in the Full Speed mode,
using the native PC Host HID/MSC drivers to which the STM322xG-EVAL board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL. In the High Speed (HS) mode the
USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

When the application is started, the user has just to plug the two USB cables into a PC host and two
USB devices (MSC/HID) are automatically detected. A new removable drive appears in the system window
for the MSC device and write/read/format operations can be performed as with any other removable drive.
A new HID Mouse device is detected, and the Joystick buttons mounted on the STM322xG-EVAL board, allow
to user to emulate the Mouse directions.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

"STM32Cube USB Device library".
      

@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" and "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Dual Core Mode

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx/STM32F217xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card into the STM322xG-EVAL uSD slot (CN6)
    - Connect the STM322xG-EVAL board to the PC through two 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cables to the connectors:
      - CN9: to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN8: to use USB Full Speed (FS)
    - Please ensure that jumpers JP16 and JP22 are in position 1-2.
    - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted.          

@par How to use it ?
