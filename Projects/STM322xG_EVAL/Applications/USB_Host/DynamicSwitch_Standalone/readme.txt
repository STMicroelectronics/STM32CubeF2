@par Application Description 

This application is a part of the USB Host Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
dynamically switch, on the same port, between available USB host applications on the STM32F2xx devices.

The USBH_RegisterClass() API is provided by the USB Host Library to load the class driver. In this 
application MSC, HID and AUDIO classes are loaded and the user can start his application depending on the
connected device. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL. In the High Speed (HS) mode the
USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

When the application is started, the connected USB device is detected in the appropriate mode 
(MSC/HID/AUDIO) and gets initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a (MSC/HID/AUDIO) Host, it enumerates the
device and extracts VID, PID, manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it 
on the LCD screen.

A menu is displayed depending on the connected device and the user can select any operation from the 
menu using the Joystick buttons.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720  
"STM32Cube USB Host library".


@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core 

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.
 
- Number of supported classes: USBH_MAX_NUM_SUPPORTED_CLASS

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx/STM32F217xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card containing .Wav audio file into the STM322xG-EVAL uSD slot (CN6)
    - Plug the USB device into the STM322xG-EVAL board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable to the connector:
      - CN9: to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN8: to use USB Full Speed (FS) with embedded PHY(U2)
    - Please ensure that jumpers JP16 and JP22 are in position 1-2.
	- Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted.


@par How to use it ?
