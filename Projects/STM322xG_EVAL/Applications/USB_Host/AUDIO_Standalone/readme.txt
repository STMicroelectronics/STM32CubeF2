@par Application Description

Use of the USB host application based on the Audio OUT class. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL. In the High Speed (HS) mode the
USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

When the application is started, the connected USB headset device is detected in AUDIO mode and gets 
initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a AUDIO Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, 
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen. 

A menu is displayed and the user can select any operation from the menu using the Joystick buttons:
 - "Explore audio file" operation searches for all .Wav files in the uSD and displays it on the LCD screen.
 - "Start audio Player" operation starts playing the song from the uSD. The files are read using the 
   FatFs file system then USBH_AUDIO_ChangeOutBuffer() function is called while playing songs and the
   bytes are stored in a circular buffer. Sampling frequency, Channels number and File size (duration) 
   are detected. The audio.c file contains a set of APIs for Audio Out playback, for example when the 
   WAV file is playing, USBH_AUDIO_SetVolume() is called to change the volume setting. This application does not 
   support compressed WAV formats.
 - "Re-Enumerate" operation performs a new Enumeration of the device.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720  
"STM32Cube USB Host library".


@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx/STM32F217xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card containing .Wav audio file into the STM322xG-EVAL uSD slot (CN6)  
    - Plug the USB headset for sound playback into the STM322xG-EVAL board through 
      'USB micro A-Male to A-Female' cable to the connector:
      - CN9: to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN8: to use USB Full Speed (FS) with embedded PHY(U2)
    - Please ensure that jumpers JP16 and JP22 are in position 1-2.
	- Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project configuration:
   - STM322xG-EVAL_USBH-HS: to configure the project for STM32F2xx devices using USB OTG HS peripheral
   - STM322xG-EVAL_USBH-FS: to configure the project for STM32F2xx devices using USB OTG FS peripheral
 - Run the application
