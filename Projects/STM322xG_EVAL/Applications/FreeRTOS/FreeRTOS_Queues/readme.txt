@par Description

How to use message queues with CMSIS RTOS API.

This application creates two threads that send and receive an incrementing number 
to/from a queue.
One thread acts as a producer and the other as the consumer.  The consumer 
is a higher priority than the producer and is set to block on queue reads. 
The queue only has space for one item - as soon as the producer posts a
message on the queue the consumer will unblock, preempt the producer, 
and remove the item.  

Add the following variables to LiveWatch, these variables must remain equals all the time:
 - ProducerValue
 - ConsumerValue

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 should toggle when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct 
      HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set 
      according to the OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and 
      rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F2xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
