@par Application Description

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run a tftp server demonstration
for STM32F2xx devices.

User has to use a PC SW tool (ex. TFTPD32) to send/receive data to/from micro SD 
card installed in STM322xG-EVAL board 

If the LCD is used (#define USE_LCD in main.h), log messages will be displayed 
to inform user about ethernet cable status and the IP address value, else this 
will be ensured by LEDs:
  + LED1: ethernet cable is connected.
  + LED2: ethernet cable is not connected.

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define USE_DHCP in main.h) 

The maximum length of filename used to send or to receive to/from uSD is set to 12 bytes

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the HAL time base to configure 
the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be set lower (numerically greater) 
than the HAL tick interrupt priority to ensure that the System tick increments while executing 
the Ethernet Link ISR.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx/STM32F217xx Devices.

  - This application has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM322xG-EVAL board
     - TFTP client and DHCP server: PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/)
  
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the eval board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
    - JP5 and JP6 jumpers should be fitted in 2-3 position
    
  - Remote PC Set-up
    - Configure a static IP address for your remote PC 
      for example 192.168.0.11 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
