@par Application Description 

This application describes the software solution for substituting standalone EEPROM
by emulating the EEPROM mechanism using the on-chip Flash of STM32F2xx devices.

Please refer to AN3390 for further details regarding this application.

The application requires two Flash memory sectors of identical size allocated to non-volatile data:
one that is initially erased, and offers byte-by-byte programmability; the other that is ready
to take over when the former sector needs to be garbage-collected. A header field that occupies
the first half word (16-bit) of each sector indicates the sector status. Each of these sectors is
considered as a page.
The sectors used are Sector 2 and Sector 3 with a size of 16KB each one.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is On when the application runs successfully.
  - LED1 is toggle in case of error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This application runs on STM32F20xxx/STM32F21xxx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM322xG-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@note
Before using the application, ensure that dedicated sectors for EEPROM (FLASH_SECTOR_2 and FLASH_SECTOR_3) 
are erased to avoid a match with a valid page OPCODE.
