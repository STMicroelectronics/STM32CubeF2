(1) User application location address is defined in the flash_if.h file as: 
#define APPLICATION_ADDRESS           ((uint32_t)0x08008000)
To modify it, change the default value to the desired one. Note that the application must be linked
relatively to the new address too.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Rev B Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the boards DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART) and PC serial port.
      (make sure that jumper JP22 is RS232_RX position pos 1-2).
    - Hold the Key push-button during reset to enter the IAP.    

  - Terminal configuration: 
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 
    - Ymodem protocol is using CRC16 by default. To switch to checksum, comment #define CRC16_F
      in ymodem.c

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Generate a binary image for the program provided in the 
     "IAP/IAP_Binary_Template" project directory. 
  2. Program the internal Flash with the IAP (see below) 
  3. Open HyperTerminal window using the settings already defined in section
     "Hardware and Software environment" 
  4. To run the IAP driver, keep the Key push-button pressed at Reset. 
     The IAP main menu is then displayed on the HyperTerminal window.
  5. To download an application, press 1 and use the Ymodem protocol

In order to load the IAP code, you have do the following:
   - EWARM:
      - Open the Project.eww workspace
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
      - Load project image: Project->Debug
      - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)

   - MDK-ARM:
      - Open the Project.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
      - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
      - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)
      
   - System Workbench for STM32: 
      - Open System Workbench for STM32 toolchain
      - Browse to the SW4STM32 workspace directory, select the project (.project file in \IAP_Main\SW4STM32 \STM322xG-EVAL directory).
      - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click on Project->build project menu.
      - Run program: Run->Debug
