@par Application Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that build the application to be
loaded into Flash memory using In-Application Programming (IAP, through USART).

To build such application, some special configuration has to be performed:
1. Set the program load address at 0x08008000, using your toolchain linker file
2. Relocate the vector table at address 0x08008000, using the "NVIC_SetVectorTable"
   function.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx/217xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STM322xG_EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to load the SysTick example with the IAP, you must do the following:
 
 - EWARM:
    - Open the Project.eww workspace
    - Rebuild all files
    - A binary file "STM322xG_EVAL_SysTick.bin" will be generated under "STM322xG_EVAL/Exe" folder.  
    - Finally load this image with IAP application

 - MDK-ARM
    - Open the Project.uvproj project
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
    - Go to "/IAP_Binary_Template/MDK-ARM" directory and run "axftobin.bat"
      (Fromelf Exe path might have to be updated in "axftobin.bat" file, according to your Keil setup).
    - A binary file "STM322xG_EVAL_SysTick.bin" will be generated under "STM322xG_EVAL" folder. 
    - Finally load this image with IAP application

 - System Workbench for STM32: 
    - Open System Workbench for STM32 toolchain
    - Browse to the SW4STM32 workspace directory, select the project 
      (.project file in \IAP_Binary_Template\SW4STM32 \STM322xG_EVAL directory).
    - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window 
      then click on Project->build project menu.
    - Load this image with the IAP application (Select option 1 in IAP_Main menu)
