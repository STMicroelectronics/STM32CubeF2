@par Example Description

How to configure and use GPIOs to toggle the on-board user LEDs 
every 250 ms. This example is based on the STM32F2xx LL API. The peripheral 
is initialized with LL unitary service functions to optimize 
for performance and size.

PB.0 IO (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop.
On NUCLEO-F207ZG board this IO is connected to LED1.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 120 MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F207ZG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F207ZG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
