@par Example Description

This example describes how to use UTILS LL API to configure the system clock using PLL with HSI as source
clock. The user application just needs to calculate PLL parameters using STM32CubeMX and call the UTILS LL
API.

System starts with clock used after reset.
Then, a system clock switch is done to PLL with HSI as PLL clock source. Automatically, FLASH latency
is tuned according to system constraints described in the reference manual.

User can easily set its own PLL parameters in changing global variable used to store them.

A LED1 toggle of 1sec provides this information that system is well configured to requested frequency.  

Anyway, signal on PA.08 can be monitored with an oscilloscope (in connecting PA.08 to pin 23 of CN12) 
to check the requested frequency:
 - SYSCLK frequency with frequency value around @120MHz divided by 4.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F207xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F207ZG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
