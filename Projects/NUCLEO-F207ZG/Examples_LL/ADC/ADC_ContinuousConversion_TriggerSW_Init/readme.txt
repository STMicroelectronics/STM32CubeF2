@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform continuous ADC conversions on a 
channel, from a software start.

This example is based on the STM32F2xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger.

Example execution:
From the first press on User Button, the ADC converts the selected channel
continuously.
After the first trigger (software start in this example), following conversions
are launched successively automatically, indefinitely.
Software polls for the first conversion completion
and stores it into a variable, LED1 is turned on.
Main program reads frequently ADC conversion data 
(without waiting for end of each conversion: software reads data 
when main program execution pointer is available and can let 
some ADC conversions data unread and overwritten by newer data)
and stores it into the same variable.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

Connection needed:
Use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED1
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 ( connector CN7 pin 17)

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F207xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F207ZG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
