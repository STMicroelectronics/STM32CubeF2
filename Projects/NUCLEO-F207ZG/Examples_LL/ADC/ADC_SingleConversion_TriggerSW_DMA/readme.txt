@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform a single ADC conversion on a channel, 
at each software start. This example uses the DMA programming model 
(for polling or interrupt programming models, refer to other examples).
This example is based on the STM32F2xx ADC LL API. The 
peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions 
for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array, in circular mode.
Note: In this example, array size can be set to 1 (equivalent to a single variable)
      to have a scenario comparable to other ADC examples using programming model
      polling or interruption.
      Size of array can be modified with literal ADC_CONVERTED_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE).

Example execution:
At each press on User Button, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected
channel.
DMA transfers conversion data to the array.
When DMA reaches the selected number of transfers,
DMA half transfer and transfer complete interruptions occurs.
Data array is updated indefinitely (DMA in circular mode).
LED1 is turned off at DMA half transfer and turned on at DMA transfer complete.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "aADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "aADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values (array of data)
 - "ubDmaTransferStatus": status of DMA transfer of ADC group regular conversion

Connection needed:
Use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED1
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 ( connector CN7 pin 17)
  DMA
