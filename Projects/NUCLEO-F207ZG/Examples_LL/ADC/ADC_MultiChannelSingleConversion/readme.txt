@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to convert several channels. ADC conversions are 
performed successively in a scan sequence.

This example is based on the STM32F2xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured in single conversion mode, from SW trigger.
Sequencer of group regular (default group available on ADC of all STM32 devices)
is configured to convert 3 channels: 1 channel from GPIO, 2 internal channels:
temperature sensor and VrefInt.
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array of size three (one array
address for conversion data of each channel), in circular mode to update
results array at each ADC sequence conversions.

Example execution:
At each press on User Button, the ADC executes the scan sequence: 
ADC performs conversion of the three selected channels successively,
in burst (discontinuous mode not enabled).
The 3 ADC conversions data are transferred by DMA into the results array
"aADCxConvertedData".
ADC conversion data of each sequence rank is at an address of the array:
 - aADCxConvertedData[0]: ADC channel set on rank1 (GPIO as analog input)
 - aADCxConvertedData[1]: ADC channel set on rank2 (VrefInt)
 - aADCxConvertedData[2]: ADC channel set on rank3 (Temperature sensor)
LED1 is turned on when ADC conversions and DMA transfer of the sequence
are completed.

ADC conversions raw data are computed to physical values
using LL ADC driver helper macro:
 - Value of voltage on GPIO pin (on which is mapped ADC channel) (unit: mV)
 - Value of internal voltage reference VrefInt (unit: mV)
 - Value of temperature (unit: degree Celsius)

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "aADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "ubDmaTransferStatus": status of DMA transfer of ADC group regular conversions
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_VoltageGPIO_mVolt":        Value of voltage on GPIO pin (on which is mapped ADC channel) (unit: mV)
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_VrefInt_mVolt":            Value of internal voltage reference VrefInt (unit: mV)
 - "hADCxConvertedData_Temperature_DegreeCelsius": Value of temperature (unit: degree Celsius)

Connection needed:
Use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED1
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 ( connector CN7 pin 17)
  DMA
