@par Example Description

How to use several ADC peripherals in multimode and interleaved mode.
This example is based on the STM32F2xx ADC LL API.
The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions 
for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Description of multimode interleaved:
ADC master instance synchronizes and manages ADC slave instance.
Multimode interleaved combines ADC instances to convert
the same channel and increase the overall ADC conversion rate.
This example configures the ADC to perform conversions at the 
maximum ADC conversion rate possible (with a sampling time  
corresponding to ADC resolution 12 bits).


Example configuration:
ADC1 and ADC2 instances (master and slave) are configured in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger (in order to reach more simply the maximum conversion rate possible,
but trigger from timer is also possible).
Both ADC instances are configured to convert a single channel (1 channel from a GPIO),
this channel is common to ADC1 and ADC2.
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array, in circular mode.
Note: One DMA channel is used (the one of ADC master) to transfer data from
      both ADC instances (master and slave).
      Usage of two DMA channels (one for ADC master, one for ADC slave) is also
      possible: this is the recommended configuration in case of high ADC
      conversions rates and applications using other DMA channels intensively.

Example execution:
From the first press on push button, the ADC converts the selected channel
continuously.
DMA transfers conversion data to the array, transfer complete interruption occurs.
Results array is updated indefinitely (DMA in circular mode).
LED1 is turned on when the DMA transfer is completed (results array full)
and turned off at next DMA half-transfer (result array first half updated).

Note: ADC is converting at high frequency, therefore LED1 is toggling at high frequency
      and will appear as dimming.
      Use an oscilloscope probe on LED1 to watch DMA transfers frequency.

Note: A file is provide with this example to detail the ADC conversions timings.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "aADCxADCyMultimodeDualConvertedData[ADC_CONVERTED_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE]": ADC multimode dual conversion data: ADC master and ADC slave conversion data are concatenated in a registers of 32 bits.
 - "aADCxMultimodeDualMasterConvertedData[ADC_CONVERTED_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE]": For the purpose of this example, dispatch multimode dual conversion data into array corresponding to ADC master conversion data.
 - "aADCyMultimodeDualSlaveConvertedData[ADC_CONVERTED_DATA_BUFFER_SIZE]": For the purpose of this example, dispatch multimode dual conversion data into array corresponding to ADC slave conversion data.
 - "ubDmaTransferStatus": status of DMA transfer of ADC group regular conversions

Connection needed:
Use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  GPIO for LED1 : PB0 (connector CN10 pin 31)
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (connector CN7 pin 17)
  DMA
