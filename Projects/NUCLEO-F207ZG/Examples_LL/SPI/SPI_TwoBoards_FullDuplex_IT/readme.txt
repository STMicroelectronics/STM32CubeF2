@par Example Description 

Data buffer transmission and receptionvia SPI using Interrupt mode. This 
example is based on the STM32F2xx SPI LL API. The peripheral 
initialization uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

The communication is done with 2 boards through SPI.

This example shows how to configure GPIO and SPI peripherals
to use a Full-Duplex communication using IT mode through the STM32F2xx COM_INSTANCE1_TYPE LL API.

The project is split in two parts the Master Board and the Slave Board:

- Master Board
  SPI1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode.
  SPI1_IRQn activated. 
  RXNE and TXE Interrupts SPI peripheral activated.
  GPIO associated to Key push-button is linked with EXTI. 
  
- Slave Board
  SPI1 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode.
  SPI1_IRQn activated. 
  RXNE and TXE Interrupts SPI peripheral activated.

The user can choose between Master and Slave through "#define MASTER_BOARD"
in the "main.c" file:
- Uncomment "#define MASTER_BOARD" to select Master board.
- Comment "#define MASTER_BOARD" to select Slave board.

Example execution:
On BOARD MASTER, LED1 is blinking Fast (200ms) and wait Key push-button action.
Press Key push-button on BOARD MASTER start a Full-Duplex communication through IT.
On MASTER side, Clock will be generated on SCK line, Transmission(MOSI Line) and reception (MISO Line) 
will be done at the same time. 
SLAVE SPI will received  the Clock (SCK Line), so Transmission(MISO Line) and reception (MOSI Line) will be done also.

LED1 is On if data is well received on both boards.

In case of errors, LED1 is blinking Slowly (1s).

@note You need to perform a reset on Master board, then perform it on Slave board
      to have the correct behaviour of this example.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F207ZG devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F207ZG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F207ZG Set-up
    - Connect Master board PA5 to Slave Board PA5 (connected to pin 10 of CN7 connector)
    - Connect Master board PA6 to Slave Board PA6 (connected to pin 12 of CN7 connector)
    - Connect Master board PA7 to Slave Board PA7 (connected to pin 14 of CN7 connector)
    - Connect Master board GND to Slave Board GND

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
    o Uncomment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
    o Comment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
