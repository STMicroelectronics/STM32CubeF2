@par Example Description

How to use the DAC peripheral to generate a voltage waveform from a digital data
stream transferred by DMA. This example is based on the STM32F2xx
DAC LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service
functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
One DAC channel (DAC1 channel1) is configured to connect DAC channel output on GPIO pin
to get the samples from DMA transfer and to get conversion trigger from timer.

Other peripherals configured in this example:
one DMA channel and one timer are configured to provide samples to be generated
by DAC peripheral:
sinus waveform, frequency 1kHz, amplitude Vdda.
(these settings can be customized by changing the defined values for the waveform generation parameters in main.c file).

Example execution:
From the main program execution, LED1 is toggling quickly while waiting for
user button press.
DMA and timer are configured and activated to transfer data and trig DAC conversion.
Then, the DAC is configured and activated: waveform is generated on DAC output
indefinitely.
DAC channel output value is provided by DMA transfer, a new value is loaded
at each trigger from trimer.
Finally, LED1 is turned-on.
LED1 is toggling slowly when error is detected.

Connection needed:
None. 
Oscilloscope for monitoring DAC channel output (cf pin below).
Other peripheral used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for DAC channel output PA.04 (Board Nucleo144: morpho connector CN11 pin 32 (in front of Arduino connector CN9 pin A2), Zio connector CN7 pin 17)
  For waveform voltage generation: 1 DMA channel, 1 timer.
