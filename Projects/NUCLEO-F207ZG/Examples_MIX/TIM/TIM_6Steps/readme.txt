@par Example Description 

Configuration of the TIM1 peripheral to generate six-step PWM signals. 
The STM32F2xx TIM1 peripheral allows programming in advance the configuration 
for the next TIM1 output behavior (or step) and changing simultaneously the configuration of all the 
channels. This operation is possible when the COM (commutation) event is used. 
This example is based on the STM32F2xx TIM HAL and LL API. The LL API is used for performance improvement.

The COM event can be generated by software by setting the COM bit in the TIM1_EGR
register or by hardware (on TRC rising edge).
In this example, a software COM event is generated each 1 ms: using the SysTick 
interrupt.

The TIM1 is configured in Timing Mode, each time a COM event occurs, a new TIM1
configuration will be set in advance. Only changed states are programmed. 

The break Polarity is used at High level.

The following Table describes the TIM1 Channels states:

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F207xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F207ZG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

  - NUCLEO-F207ZG Set-up
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  PE.09: connected to pin 4 of CN10 connector  
      - TIM1_CH1N PE.08: connected to pin 18 of CN10 connector 
      - TIM1_CH2  PE.11: connected to pin 6 of CN10 connector 
      - TIM1_CH2N PE.10: connected to pin 24 of CN10 connector 
      - TIM1_CH3  PE.13: connected to pin 10 of CN10 connector 
      - TIM1_CH3N PE.12: connected to pin 26 of CN10 connector 

    - Connect the TIM1 break to the GND. To generate a break event, switch this
      pin level from 0V to 3.3V.  
      - TIM1_BKIN  PE.15: connected to pin 30 of CN10 connector
