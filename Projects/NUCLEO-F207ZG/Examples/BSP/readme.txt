@par Example Description 

The BSP examples detects the presence of Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield with joystick and uSD.

If the Adafruit shield is NOT connected, then:
 - Blue led (led2) blinks waiting the user button is pushed.
 - When user button is pressed : LED1 (green) and LED2 (blue) start blinking at high frequency.
 - Pushing user button again and again blinking frequency decreases until looping 
   to high frequency.

If the Adafruit shield is connected, then this example shows how to use the different 
functionalities of LCD, SD card and joystick by switching between tests using user button. 
  - Firstly, use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle 
    (up/down/right/left) and change the pointer color(select).
  - Secondly, this example shows how to use the different LCD features to display 
    string with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.
  - Thirdly, this example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card.
At the end of the nine examples when pushing the user button the application loops 
to the beginning (first examples).

@par Hardware and Software environment

 - This Demo runs on STM32F2xx Devices 
  
 - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-207ZG Rev.B (MB1137) 
   and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

 - NUCLEO-207ZG Set-up
   - Connect the Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield (https://www.adafruit.com/products/802)
