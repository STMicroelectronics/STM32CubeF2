@par Application Description 

Use of the USB host application based on the HID class.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F207xG USB OTG Host peripheral to interact with an USB 
HID Device such as a Mouse or a Keyboard.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from the PLL.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB FS can be derived from PLL clock (clocked by the HSE), 
the PLL clock must be programmed to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/PLLQ).

When the application is started, the connected HID device (Mouse/Keyboard) is detected in HID mode and 
gets initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a HID Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, 
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen. 
This application is based on interacting with a HID device (Mouse/Keyboard) trough a HID routine.
LCD and joystick are provided by Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield to be plugged on Arduino connectors.

A menu is displayed and the user can select any operation from the menu using the Joystick buttons:
   - "Start HID" operation starts the appropriate HID application to the attached HID Device.
   - "Start Mouse / Re-Initialize" operation starts Mouse HID application. Moving the mouse will move
    the pointer in the display rectangle and if a button is pressed, the corresponding rectangle will be
    highlighted in Blue.
   - "Start Keyboard / Clear" operation starts Keyboard HID application. Taped Keyboard characters are 
   displayed on the LCD screen.
   - "Re-Enumerate" operation performs a new Enumeration of the device.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

"STM32Cube USB Host library".

@par USB Library Configuration

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-207ZG Rev.B boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-207ZG Set-up
    - Plug a USB device mouse or keyboard into the NUCLEO-207ZG board 
      through 'USB micro A-Male to A-Female' cable

  - Make sure that the jumper JP4 is closed

  - Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield must be connected on CN5,CN6, CN8 and CN9 Arduino connectors, 
    for more details please refer to UM1726.
