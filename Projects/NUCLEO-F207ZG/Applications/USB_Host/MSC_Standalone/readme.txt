@par Application Description

Use of the USB host application based on the Mass Storage Class (MSC).

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F207xG USB OTG Host peripheral to operate with an USB 
flash disk using the Bulk Only Transfer (BOT) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) transparent
commands combined with a file system FatFs (Middleware component).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from the PLL.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB FS can be derived from PLL clock (clocked by the HSE), 
the PLL clock must be programmed to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/PLLQ).

When the application is started, the connected USB flash disk device is detected in MSC mode and gets 
initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a MSC Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, 
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen. 
This application is based on read/write file and explore the USB flash disk content through a MSC routine.
LCD and joystick are provided by Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield to be plugged on Arduino connectors.

User can start any operations using User button:
 - "File Operations" operation writes a small text file (less to 1 KB) on the USB flash disk.
 - "Explorer Disk" operation explores the USB flash disk content and displays it on the LCD screen.
    User has to press the User button to display the whole USB flash disk content (recursion level 2).

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

"STM32Cube USB Host library".

@par USB Library Configuration

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-207ZG Rev.B 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and board.

  - NUCLEO-207ZG Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the NUCLEO-207ZG board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable to the connector:

  - Make sure that the jumper JP4 is closed

  - Adafruit 1.8" TFT shield must be connected on CN5,CN6, CN8 and CN9 Arduino connectors, 
    for more details please refer to UM1726.
