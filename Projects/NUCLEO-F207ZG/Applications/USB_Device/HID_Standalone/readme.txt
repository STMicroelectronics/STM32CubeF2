@par Application Description 

Use of the USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID).

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F207xG USB OTG Device peripheral where the STM32 MCU is
enumerated as a HID device using the native PC Host HID driver to which the NUCLEO-207ZG
board is connected, in order to emulate the mouse using user button mounted on nucleo board.
Each time user press button, the host mouse pointer moves horizontally.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 120 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from the PLL.
 
This application supports remote wakeup (which is the ability of a USB device to bring a suspended bus back
to the active condition), and the User button is used as the remote wakeup source. 
   
By default, in Windows powered PC the Power Management feature of USB mouse devices is turned off.
This setting is different from classic PS/2 computer functionality. Therefore, to enable the Wake from 
standby option, user must manually turn on the Power Management feature for the USB mouse.

To manually enable the wake from standby option for the USB mouse, proceed as follows: 
 - Start "Device Manager",
 - Select "Mice and other pointing devices",
 - Select the "HID-compliant mouse" device 
 - Make sure that PID &VID are equal to 0x5710 & 0x0483 respectively by selecting "Details" tab 
   and setting Property to "Hardware Ids"
 - Right click and select "Properties", 
 - Select "Power Management" tab,
 - Finally click to select "Allow this device to wake the computer" check box.

The function GetPointerData() is responsible to move the mouse cursor automatically,
which can be easily customized (square, circle...). In this application the cursor
is moving forward and backward in an infinite loop.
 
LED1, LED2 and LED3 are blinking continuously. 
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F207xG devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-207ZG Rev.B boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-207ZG Set-up
    - Connect the NUCLEO-207ZG board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cable to the connector: 
    - CN13: to use USB Full Speed (FS)

  - Make sure that the jumper JP4 is closed

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
